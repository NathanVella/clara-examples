# _About_

This project contains example use [clara-rules](http://github.com/cerner/clara-rules), a Clojure-based rule engine. It is primarily for documentation and examples for those learning Clara.

# _Usage_

---
### Nate Edits
Make sure you are running java version 8. The examples won't work with any other java versions. 
To set java 8:
``` bash
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`
```
Install Leiningen by using: `brew install leiningen`

Continue with below instructions. 

---

The Clojure examples can be run via the [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) build system. Simply check out this project and run the following from its root directory on a system where Leiningen is installed:

```bash
lein run -m clara.examples
```

To run the [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org) examples, compile the code with ```lein compile``` or ```lein cljsbuild once```, and then open the ```resources/public/index.html``` file in a browser. This will run the [shopping example](https://github.com/cerner/clara-examples/blob/master/src/main/clojurescript/clara/examples/shopping.cljs) in ClojureScript and display the result.

# _Building_

Like clara-rules, this example project is built, tested, and deployed using [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org).
